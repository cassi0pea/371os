// implementing split_at_mut
//
// apparently this is a standard library function (or method? it seems to work on
// "slice.split_at_mut(3)" lingo. it:
// 
// Inputs:      a mutable slice, an index to split it at
// Outputs:     two slices, split at the given index
// Side FX:     None

// a slice is a data type -- it is a reference to "a contiguous sequence of elements in a
// collection"
// A "collection" is stuff like string, vector (calling them arrays is illegal i guess), hash map




fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
